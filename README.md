# PRIVATECOINS

## Why we need private coins?

Right now, digital payments are fundamentally lacking in privacy — they are surveilled, analyzed, collected, and sold. With every online purchase, your metadata for that transaction is stored (from what IP you used, to your physical location, to your purchase history, and more).

Privacy leads to innovation, social evolution.

Blockchain is an open distrubuted ledger that can record transactions between teo parties in a verifiable and permanent way but it is open soucrce anybody can see your transactions. Due to open source nature of blockchain people can see your tractions and how much cryptos you have and how you are spending it it leads to various types of concerns thats why we need private coins 

Private coins  can secure your  tranactions as well as hide your identity 

“The lack of financial privacy is detrimental to most cryptocurrency use cases,” they continue. “We do believe if users were using the technology in a sound way or a privacy-focused wallet software would have helped them and abstracted away potential privacy leaks.

# How the transaction take place in crypto coins 

## UTXO'S (UNSPENT TRANSACTION OUTPUT)
The term UTXO refers to the amount of digital currency someone has left remaining after executing a cryptocurrency transaction such as bitcoin. The letters stand for unspent transaction output. Each bitcoin transaction begins with coins used to balance the ledger. UTXOs are processed continuously and are responsible for beginning and ending each transaction. Although confirmation of transaction results in the removal of spent coins from the UTXO database, a record of the spent coins still exists on the ledger. 

### How a UTXO Works?
UTXO transactions sound complicated, but they really are fairly simple. UTXO or unspent transaction outputs are used in cryptocurrency transactions. These are the transactions that are left unspent after someone completes a transaction, similar to the change someone receives after conducting a cash transaction at the store.


Here's how it works. A UTXO database is used to store change from cryptocurrency transactions. This database or ledger is initially set to empty or zero. As transactions multiply, the database becomes populated with change records from various transactions. When a transaction is completed and there are outputs that aren't spent, they are deposited back into a database as inputs that can be used at a later date for a new transaction. Cryptocurrency transactions—such as those used for bitcoins—are similar to cashier checks. You cannot exchange them for custom amounts and must spend the entire amount stored in that data byte.

But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are also unique in that transactions can be conducted using fractions of the cryptocurrency. This means spending does not take place using a single data byte. Instead, multiple fractions of bitcoin are retrieved by the algorithm to fulfill a spending request. For example, a purchase worth 1 bitcoin may retrieve 0.6 BTC from one byte and 0.4 BTC from another. Change from each of these fractions is then sent to the UTXO database to be spent at a later date.
