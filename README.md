# PRIVATECOINS

## Why we need private coins?

Right now, digital payments are fundamentally lacking in privacy — they are surveilled, analyzed, collected, and sold. With every online purchase, your metadata for that transaction is stored (from what IP you used, to your physical location, to your purchase history, and more).

Privacy leads to innovation, social evolution.

Blockchain is an open distrubuted ledger that can record transactions between teo parties in a verifiable and permanent way but it is open soucrce anybody can see your transactions. Due to open source nature of blockchain people can see your tractions and how much cryptos you have and how you are spending it it leads to various types of concerns thats why we need private coins 

Private coins  can secure your  tranactions as well as hide your identity 

“The lack of financial privacy is detrimental to most cryptocurrency use cases,” they continue. “We do believe if users were using the technology in a sound way or a privacy-focused wallet software would have helped them and abstracted away potential privacy leaks.
