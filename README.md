# PRIVATECOINS

## Why we need private coins?

Right now, digital payments are fundamentally lacking in privacy â€” they are surveilled, analyzed, collected, and sold. With every online purchase, your metadata for that transaction is stored (from what IP you used, to your physical location, to your purchase history, and more).

Privacy leads to innovation, social evolution.
